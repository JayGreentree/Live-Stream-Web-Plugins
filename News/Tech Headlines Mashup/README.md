# Tech Headlines

This plugin shows current headlines from CoinTelegraph and Recode.net. This plugin grabs current news and combines it with your show news. You'll notice that there is a few headlines that have to do with social media; again customize the JS to alter this.

There is a CORS hack in use here, you'll see in the code if you care. Add/remove RSS feeds as you like.
