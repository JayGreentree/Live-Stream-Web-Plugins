# Live Stream Web Plugins

This repo contains free easy-to-use plugins that can enhance your Live Streaming production.

## What can you do?

Let's say you want to add a crawler to the bottom of your page but want it plugged into a news feed rather than type it in. Use [this](https://github.com/kgiszewski/Live-Stream-Web-Plugins/tree/master/News/Tech%20Headlines) plugin to pull that off. It will looks something like this:

Each plugin is a tiny webpage powered with CSS, Javascript and HTML. 

Don't like the styles, change them locally.

Want to integrate with a different feed? Alter it.

## Want to contribute?

Send a PR to this repo for either changes to existing plugins or brand new ones. I would prefer not to get pretty much the same plugin with different styles, please only send meaningful updates. Please provide a thumbnail and a README.md for new plugins.

## OBS and XSplit Support

All of these plugins work with OBS and XSplit since they just use the browser view in each respective app. 

## Install

Download the whole repo or just what you want. Simply choose a local file from inside OBS or XSplit on your production computer. Move the plugin on the screen to the desired spot. Enjoy.

## Browse the plugins

Each plugin has a README and a thumbnail, browse the repo to discover more.
